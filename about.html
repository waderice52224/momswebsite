        <p>Dance is my preferred form of self expression and has been my whole life. I was blessed to be able to take dance classes throughout most of my childhood. In high school I was on the Drill Team, Dance Company, The Sterling Scholar for my High School and also part of a private Ballet Company. At Ricks College I was part of The Contemporary Dance Theater and able to tour Great Britain with the ExtravaDance Team. I was also on "Style", a dance company devoted to teaching social dances. My last year of college was my Jr. Year at BYU where I was accepted into the Dance Program majoring in Composite Dance. My husband was accepted into Optometry School so we moved to Oregon before I could finish my degree. The Dance Professor at Pacific University had compassion on the wives of the enrolled students and allowed us to participate in her classes when available which was a God-send to us. When we moved back from Oregon I became the Director of the Dance Program at the Legacy Center in Lehi. I was the director for 8 years and instructed there for 10 years. After much anticipation I am very excited to create my own Dance Company!</p>
